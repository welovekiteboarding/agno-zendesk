## Task 1: Create Guardrails Schema for Form Collection

- Created foundational JSON schema structure with required bug report fields and types. [pending]
- Added regex pattern validations for email and app version fields. [pending]
- Implemented minimum line count validations for descriptive fields. [pending]
- Defined enumeration constraints for severity/impact field. [pending]
- Added support for optional attachments and GDPR consent. [pending]
- Verified schema with Ajv JSON schema validator tests covering valid and invalid payloads. [pending]

This comprehensive work is planned to ensure robust validation and data integrity for bug report submissions in the system.

The code changes to be completed can be summarized as follows:

1. **Add `__init__.py` file**: This file will mark the `agents_from_scratch` directory as a Python package. [pending]

2. **Add compiled Python files**: Compiled Python files (`.pyc` files) will be generated in the `__pycache__` directory after code execution. [pending]

3. **Add new Python files**: The following new Python files are to be created:
   - `form_collector_agent.py`: Defines the `FormCollectorAgent` class, which is the main agent class responsible for collecting and processing user input. [pending]
   - ...
The code changes can be summarized as follows:

- **Added `__init__.py` file**: This file marks the `agents_from_scratch` directory as a Python package.
- **Added compiled Python files**: Several compiled Python files (`.pyc` files) have been added to the `__pycache__` directory, indicating that the code has been compiled and cached for faster execution.
- **Added new Python files**: The following new Python files have been added:
  - `form_collector_agent.py`: Defines the `FormCollectorAgent` class, which is the main agent class responsible for collecting and processing user input.
  - `form_collector_agent_flow
