# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Logging and Metrics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add comprehensive logging and metrics collection to track system performance and success rates.
# Details:
Implement logging to CloudWatch (AGNO-bug-report-logs) or Vercel Analytics for all key events. Log success/failure events for each step in the pipeline. Track metrics for submission success rate, time to ticket creation, and other success metrics defined in the PRD. Implement performance monitoring to ensure the system meets the requirement of ticket creation in <4s (p95) after the last user message. Add logging for security events such as authentication failures or suspicious upload attempts.

# Test Strategy:
Verify logs are correctly generated for all key events. Test metrics collection and reporting. Simulate various scenarios including successes and failures to ensure all events are properly logged. Validate that performance metrics are accurately captured.
