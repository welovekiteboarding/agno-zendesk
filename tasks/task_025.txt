# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Agent-Driven Multi-Database RAG Architecture with Agno Native Capabilities
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a sophisticated RAG implementation that utilizes Agno's agent capabilities (planners, leaders, reflection, research) to intelligently route queries across 5 AstraDB collections and synthesize comprehensive responses.
# Details:
This task requires implementing a multi-database RAG architecture leveraging Agno's existing agent frameworks and patterns from cookbook examples. The architecture should:

1. Use Agno's planner capabilities to analyze incoming user queries and determine which of the 5 AstraDB collections are most relevant to address the query
2. Implement leader agent patterns to orchestrate the retrieval operations across the selected databases
3. Utilize reflection capabilities to evaluate the quality and relevance of retrieved information
4. Employ research agent patterns to synthesize information from multiple sources into coherent responses
5. Follow the existing code structures and patterns in the Agno cookbook examples rather than creating new frameworks
6. Implement a routing mechanism that considers:
   - Query intent classification
   - Semantic similarity to collection content domains
   - Historical performance of collections for similar queries
7. Create a result synthesis component that:
   - Removes redundant information from multiple collections
   - Resolves conflicting information with appropriate reasoning
   - Structures responses based on information relevance and completeness
8. Implement appropriate error handling and fallback strategies when specific collections are unavailable
9. Add telemetry to track which collections are being used for different query types to enable future optimization

The implementation should be modular enough to allow adding or removing collections without significant code changes.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify the effectiveness of the multi-database RAG architecture through these methods:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test the query analysis component with various query types to ensure correct database selection
   - Verify the routing logic correctly identifies which collections to query based on different inputs
   - Test the synthesis component with known conflicting information to ensure proper resolution

2. Integration Tests:
   - Create a test suite with 25+ diverse queries spanning topics covered by all 5 collections
   - Verify that appropriate collections are queried for each test case
   - Measure response synthesis quality through automated metrics (coherence, relevance, factuality)

3. Performance Tests:
   - Measure latency for different query patterns (single collection vs. multi-collection queries)
   - Test system under load to ensure performance degradation is graceful
   - Verify resource usage remains within acceptable bounds during peak operations

4. Simulation Tests:
   - Simulate collection unavailability to verify fallback mechanisms work correctly
   - Test with deliberately ambiguous queries to verify the system makes reasonable collection choices

5. Validation Metrics:
   - Track correct collection selection rate (compared to human-labeled ground truth)
   - Measure information completeness in synthesized responses
   - Calculate redundancy and conflict resolution effectiveness

All tests should include specific examples covering each of the 5 collections to ensure comprehensive coverage.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Multi-Database AstraDB Configuration and Query Analysis System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure the 5 AstraDB collections and implement the query analysis system that will determine which collections to query based on intent classification and semantic similarity.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Configure connection settings for all 5 AstraDB collections following Agno cookbook patterns
2. Implement a configuration manager to store and retrieve collection metadata (domain focus, query types handled, etc.)
3. Create a query intent classifier using Agno's planner agent capabilities that:
   - Analyzes incoming user queries
   - Classifies query intent into predefined categories
   - Maps intents to relevant collections
4. Implement a semantic similarity module that:
   - Embeds user queries using the same embedding model as the collections
   - Calculates similarity scores between the query and each collection's domain description
   - Ranks collections by relevance score
5. Develop a collection selection algorithm that combines intent classification and similarity scores
6. Create unit tests for each component:
   - Test connection to all collections
   - Verify intent classification with sample queries
   - Validate semantic similarity scoring
   - Ensure collection selection works for various query types
7. Implement logging for query analysis decisions to support future telemetry

## 2. Implement Leader Agent for Multi-Database Retrieval Orchestration [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Create a leader agent that orchestrates the retrieval operations across the selected databases, including handling concurrent queries, error handling, and fallback strategies.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Extend Agno's leader agent pattern to create a RAGLeaderAgent class that:
   - Takes the collection selection output from subtask 1
   - Orchestrates parallel retrieval operations across selected collections
   - Manages timeouts and concurrency
2. Implement collection-specific retrieval agents that:
   - Connect to their assigned AstraDB collection
   - Execute semantic searches with appropriate parameters
   - Format retrieved documents consistently
3. Create an error handling and fallback system that:
   - Detects when collections are unavailable or return errors
   - Implements retry logic with backoff
   - Falls back to alternative collections when primary ones fail
   - Logs errors for monitoring
4. Develop a retrieval results collector that:
   - Aggregates results from all queried collections
   - Normalizes document formats from different sources
   - Applies initial deduplication
5. Implement a reflection agent that evaluates retrieved results for:
   - Relevance to the original query
   - Coverage of different aspects of the query
   - Identification of information gaps
6. Create unit and integration tests that:
   - Verify parallel retrieval works correctly
   - Test error handling with simulated failures
   - Validate the reflection agent's evaluation
7. Add telemetry to track retrieval performance per collection

## 3. Develop Response Synthesis and Telemetry System [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1, 25.2
### Description: Create a research agent that synthesizes information from multiple collections into coherent responses, resolves conflicts, and implements telemetry for tracking system performance.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Implement a ResearchAgent class based on Agno patterns that:
   - Takes aggregated retrieval results from the leader agent
   - Analyzes information for redundancies and conflicts
   - Synthesizes a comprehensive response
2. Create an information synthesis module that:
   - Removes duplicate information across collection results
   - Identifies and resolves conflicting information with reasoning
   - Structures information by relevance and completeness
   - Cites sources appropriately
3. Implement a response generator that:
   - Formats the synthesized information into a coherent response
   - Adapts to different response formats based on query intent
   - Handles cases where information is incomplete
4. Develop a comprehensive telemetry system that tracks:
   - Which collections were queried for each request
   - Retrieval performance metrics per collection
   - Synthesis quality metrics
   - End-to-end processing time
5. Create a feedback mechanism to store query-collection-performance data for future optimization
6. Implement an integration layer that connects the entire system to Agno's existing agent infrastructure
7. Develop end-to-end tests that:
   - Verify the complete flow from query to response
   - Test with various query types across different domains
   - Validate telemetry data collection
   - Ensure the system degrades gracefully with partial collection failures
8. Create documentation for the overall architecture and component interactions
