# Task ID: 17
# Title: Task #17: Standardize Python Imports to Absolute Package Paths
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update all Python imports across the project to use absolute package imports instead of file-relative imports to ensure compatibility with various execution environments including tests, scripts, and containerized deployments.
# Details:
This task involves systematically refactoring all Python import statements throughout the codebase to follow a consistent absolute import pattern. The developer should:

1. Identify all Python files in the project, with special focus on the cookbook/agents_from_scratch directory and other package folders.
2. Convert relative imports (e.g., from ..utils import helper) to absolute imports (e.g., from cookbook.utils import helper).
3. Ensure imports follow the pattern: from [root_package].[sub_package].[module] import [object].
4. Pay special attention to circular import dependencies that might be revealed during this refactoring.
5. Update any import-related configurations in pyproject.toml, setup.py, or other package definition files if necessary.
6. Verify that imports work correctly when running code from different entry points (main script, test runner, etc.).
7. Document any special cases or exceptions where absolute imports cannot be applied.
8. Consider using tools like isort to standardize import formatting after the conversion.
9. Update any documentation or examples that reference the import style.

This standardization will resolve issues where code works in one context (e.g., local development) but fails in others (e.g., Docker containers or CI/CD pipelines) due to Python's module resolution behavior.

# Test Strategy:
To verify the successful completion of this task:

1. Run a static analysis check to confirm all imports follow the absolute pattern:
   - Use a custom script or grep to identify any remaining relative imports (e.g., `grep -r "from \.\." --include="*.py" .`)
   - Verify no imports use leading dots (.) which indicate relative imports

2. Execute comprehensive test coverage across different environments:
   - Run the full test suite locally using pytest to verify tests pass with the new import style
   - Execute tests in a Docker container to confirm imports work in containerized environments
   - Verify functionality in any CI/CD pipeline environments (GitHub Actions, etc.)
   - Test running scripts from different directories to ensure imports resolve correctly regardless of working directory

3. Perform integration testing:
   - Test any entry points defined in setup.py or pyproject.toml
   - Verify that imported modules can be accessed when package is installed via pip
   - Check that imports work correctly when running the application through any deployment scripts

4. Code review:
   - Have another developer review the changes to ensure consistency
   - Verify that import statements follow the team's style guidelines
   - Confirm that any circular import issues have been properly addressed

5. Document any exceptions or special cases where absolute imports couldn't be applied and the workarounds implemented.
