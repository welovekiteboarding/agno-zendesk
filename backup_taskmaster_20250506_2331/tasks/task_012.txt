# Task ID: 12
# Title: Next.js Scaffold for Widget
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a Next.js application in the frontend/ directory to serve as the foundation for the chat UI and provide Vercel with a build target.
# Details:
Initialize a new Next.js application in the frontend/ directory using the following command: `npx create-next-app@latest`. During setup, select the following options:
- Use TypeScript: Yes
- Enable ESLint: Yes
- Use Tailwind CSS: Yes
- Configure import aliases: Yes (use '@/' as the prefix)

After initialization, ensure the project structure is clean and organized. Update the README.md file with basic information about the project, including setup instructions and development commands. Configure the next.config.js file as needed for any specific project requirements. This scaffold will allow UI development to proceed in parallel with backend work, providing a foundation for the chat interface components that will be developed later. Make sure the package.json includes appropriate scripts for development, building, and testing.

# Test Strategy:
1. Run the development server locally using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` and verify that the default page loads correctly at http://localhost:3000
2. Deploy the application to Vercel by connecting the repository and configuring the build settings to target the frontend/ directory
3. After deployment, verify that the application builds successfully without errors in the Vercel build logs
4. Access the deployed Vercel URL and confirm that the default Next.js page renders correctly
5. Test basic navigation within the app to ensure routing is working properly
6. Verify that Tailwind CSS is properly configured by checking that the default styling is applied
7. Run ESLint using `npm run lint` to ensure the code quality tools are properly configured
