# Task ID: 24
# Title: Multi-Database RAG Architecture with Intelligent Routing
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a sophisticated multi-database RAG architecture with intelligent routing for the Agno agent. The system will integrate with 5 different AstraDB collections, with the agent using reasoning capabilities to determine which database(s) to query based on the user's question.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Fix AstraDB Connector and Create Base Multi-Database Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Fix the AstraDB connector parameter issue and implement the foundational multi-database architecture that can connect to all 5 AstraDB collections.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Debug and fix the AstraDB connector parameter issue by examining the current error logs and ensuring proper authentication parameters are being passed.
2. Create a unified connector class that can handle connections to multiple AstraDB collections (General, SkySafari, Starry Night, Celestron, and User Queries).
3. Implement a configuration system that stores connection details for each collection.
4. Create a basic routing mechanism that can query a specific collection based on an explicit collection name parameter.
5. Test the connector with each collection individually to ensure proper connection and data retrieval.
6. Implement error handling for connection failures and query timeouts.

Testing approach:
- Unit test the connector with mock AstraDB responses
- Integration test with actual AstraDB collections
- Test error handling by simulating connection failures

## 2. Implement Domain Classification and Intelligent Routing Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Develop the domain classification system in the Leader Agent to analyze user queries and determine which specialized collections to query, with appropriate routing logic.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Design and implement a domain classifier that can categorize user queries into relevant domains (astronomy software, telescope hardware, general astronomy knowledge, etc.).
2. Train or fine-tune the classifier on a dataset of sample queries labeled with appropriate domains.
3. Integrate the classifier with the Leader Agent's reasoning system.
4. Implement routing logic that maps classified domains to specific AstraDB collections:
   - SkySafari queries → SkySafari collection
   - Starry Night queries → Starry Night collection
   - Telescope hardware queries → Celestron collection
   - General astronomy → General collection
   - User history → User Queries collection
5. Add logic for multi-collection querying when a question spans multiple domains.
6. Implement query transformation to optimize retrieval for each specific collection.

Testing approach:
- Test classification accuracy on a validation set of queries
- End-to-end testing with sample user questions
- Evaluate routing decisions against expected collection choices

## 3. Implement Post-Retrieval Processing and Clarification Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1, 24.2
### Description: Add post-retrieval filtering, relevance scoring, and an optional clarification mechanism for ambiguous queries to improve response quality.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Implement post-retrieval filtering to remove irrelevant or low-quality results based on semantic similarity and content analysis.
2. Develop a domain relevance scoring system that ranks retrieved documents based on their relevance to the identified domain.
3. Create a clarification mechanism that triggers when:
   - The domain classification confidence is below a threshold
   - The query could belong to multiple domains with similar confidence
   - Initial retrieval results have low relevance scores
4. Design clarification prompts that ask users specific questions to disambiguate their intent.
5. Implement a feedback loop where clarification responses refine the domain classification and query routing.
6. Update the documentation to reflect the complete intelligent routing architecture including all components and their interactions.
7. Create visualization diagrams of the data flow through the system.

Testing approach:
- Test filtering effectiveness by measuring precision/recall on test queries
- User testing of the clarification mechanism with ambiguous queries
- End-to-end testing of the complete RAG system with various query types
- Performance testing to ensure response times remain acceptable
