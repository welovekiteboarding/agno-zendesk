# Task ID: 12
# Title: Establish Contextâ€‘Management Workflow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up project-wide context management before further coding. Create project brief, rolling summary, auto-summary CI, and update task dependencies.
# Details:
1. Create docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md with project vision, impact, and scope. 2. Create docs/CONTEXT_SUMMARY.md as a rolling summary. 3. Add GitHub Action to auto-update context summary on PR merge. 4. Create scripts/summarize_pr.py for PR summarization. 5. Update README.md with context management section. 6. Patch tasks.json and update dependencies.

# Test Strategy:
Open a dummy PR, merge it, and confirm the GitHub Action appends a new entry to docs/CONTEXT_SUMMARY.md.
