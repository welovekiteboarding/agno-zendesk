# Task ID: 14
# Title: DNS & TLS Configuration for Bug Widget and API Endpoints
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure DNS records and TLS certificates for bug-widget.yourdomain.com (Vercel) and api-bug.yourdomain.com (Render/Fly/Cloud-Run) to ensure secure communication.
# Details:
This task involves setting up proper DNS configuration and TLS certificates for two domains:

1. For bug-widget.yourdomain.com (Vercel):
   - Create a CNAME record pointing to Vercel's servers (typically cname.vercel-dns.com)
   - Configure the domain in Vercel's dashboard
   - Let Vercel handle the automatic TLS certificate provisioning

2. For api-bug.yourdomain.com (Render/Fly/Cloud-Run):
   - Create appropriate DNS records based on the hosting platform:
     - For Render: CNAME to [app-name].render.com
     - For Fly.io: CNAME to [app-name].fly.dev
     - For Cloud Run: CNAME or ALIAS to ghs.googlehosted.com
   - Configure the domain in the respective platform's dashboard
   - Set up TLS certificates (either through the platform's automatic provisioning or manually with Let's Encrypt)

3. Documentation:
   - Create a markdown document in the project repository detailing:
     - DNS provider used and configuration steps
     - TLS certificate source and renewal process
     - Any platform-specific settings applied
     - Troubleshooting tips for common issues
   - Include screenshots of the configuration panels where helpful

4. Ensure both domains have proper HTTP to HTTPS redirects configured.

# Test Strategy:
1. DNS Verification:
   - Use `dig` or `nslookup` to verify DNS records are correctly configured
   - Example: `dig bug-widget.yourdomain.com` should show the correct CNAME
   - Check DNS propagation using multiple DNS checkers (e.g., whatsmydns.net)

2. TLS Certificate Validation:
   - Access both endpoints via HTTPS in multiple browsers
   - Verify certificate validity using browser developer tools
   - Check certificate details (issuer, expiration date, domain coverage)
   - Use SSL checking tools like SSL Labs (ssllabs.com/ssltest/) to verify proper configuration
   - Verify TLS version (should be TLS 1.2 or 1.3) and cipher suites

3. Security Headers:
   - Use security header checking tools (securityheaders.com) to verify proper headers
   - Ensure HSTS is enabled where appropriate

4. Redirect Testing:
   - Verify that HTTP requests redirect to HTTPS
   - Test with curl: `curl -I http://bug-widget.yourdomain.com`
   - Confirm 301/302 redirect to HTTPS version

5. End-to-end Testing:
   - Verify that API calls from the widget to the API endpoint work correctly over HTTPS
   - Test with sample API requests to confirm secure communication
