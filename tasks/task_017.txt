# Task ID: 17
# Title: Documentation & Knowledge-Transfer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Prepare comprehensive documentation including DevOps runbook, API contract, and onboarding guide to facilitate knowledge transfer and quick onboarding of new team members.
# Details:
Create three main documentation components:
1. DevOps Runbook: Document all deployment processes, infrastructure setup, configuration management, and environment details. Include step-by-step instructions for common operations.
2. API Contract: Document all API endpoints, request/response formats, authentication methods, error handling, and versioning strategy. Include examples for each endpoint.
3. Onboarding Guide: Create a comprehensive guide that walks new developers through project setup, architecture overview, coding standards, workflow processes, and access requirements.

Additional requirements:
- Document the agent pipeline configuration and execution flow
- Include troubleshooting sections with common issues and their solutions
- Add a glossary of project-specific terms
- Ensure all documentation is version-controlled alongside the codebase
- Use diagrams where appropriate to illustrate system architecture and workflows
- Include environment setup instructions for local development
- Document all configuration parameters and their purposes

# Test Strategy:
1. Recruit a developer who is unfamiliar with the project to follow the documentation
2. Observe them as they attempt to:
   - Set up the development environment from scratch
   - Deploy the application to a test environment
   - Make a simple code change and push it through the pipeline
   - Understand and use the API based on the contract
   - Troubleshoot a simulated common issue
3. Document any points of confusion or missing information
4. Have the developer provide written feedback on clarity and completeness
5. Revise documentation based on feedback
6. Conduct a final review with the team to ensure technical accuracy
7. Verify all links, references, and screenshots are current and accurate
