# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement End-to-End Integration and OAuth Flow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Connect all components and implement the OAuth authentication flow for Zendesk API access.
# Details:
Integrate all agents and services into a complete pipeline. Implement OAuth client for Zendesk with required scopes (tickets:write, uploads:write, users:read write). Store OAuth tokens securely in a secret manager. Implement the full user flow from clicking 'Report a Bug' through conversation to ticket creation and confirmation. Add a confirmation screen with ticket link and 'View my tickets' button. Ensure all components communicate correctly and handle errors appropriately.

# Test Strategy:
Perform end-to-end testing of the complete flow. Test OAuth authentication and token refresh. Verify all components interact correctly. Test error scenarios at each stage of the pipeline. Confirm the user receives appropriate feedback throughout the process.
