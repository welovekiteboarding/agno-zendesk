# Task ID: 12
# Title: Next.js Scaffold for Widget
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Scaffold a Next.js application in the frontend/ directory to provide Vercel with a build target and host the chat UI.
# Details:
Create a new Next.js application in the frontend/ directory using the following command: `npx create-next-app@latest`. During setup, select the following options:

1. Enable TypeScript support
2. Enable ESLint integration
3. Enable Tailwind CSS for styling
4. Configure import aliases for cleaner imports

After scaffolding, ensure the project structure is properly organized and that the configuration files (next.config.js, tsconfig.json, etc.) are correctly set up. Update the README.md in the frontend directory with setup and development instructions. This scaffolding will serve as the foundation for the chat UI and will allow frontend development to proceed in parallel with backend work. The initial commit should include only the basic scaffolded application without custom components or business logic.

# Test Strategy:
1. Run the development server locally using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` and verify that it starts without errors
2. Check that TypeScript compilation works without errors using `npm run build` or `yarn build`
3. Verify ESLint is properly configured by running `npm run lint` or `yarn lint`
4. Test that Tailwind CSS is working by adding a simple styled component
5. Test import aliases by creating a simple import that uses the configured alias
6. Deploy the scaffolded application to Vercel and verify that:
   - The build process completes successfully
   - The default Next.js page is accessible at the deployed URL
   - The page renders correctly across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
7. Document the Vercel deployment URL in the task completion notes
