# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Monitoring & Alerting System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting infrastructure using CloudWatch and Vercel metrics to track application health and performance across both backend and frontend systems.
# Details:
This task involves implementing a robust monitoring and alerting system with the following components:

1. CloudWatch Integration:
   - Set up CloudWatch metrics for backend services
   - Configure custom metrics for API response times, error rates, and resource utilization
   - Create CloudWatch dashboards for visualizing key performance indicators

2. Vercel Metrics Integration:
   - Implement Vercel Analytics for frontend performance monitoring
   - Track core web vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) and custom frontend metrics
   - Set up real-time monitoring of client-side errors

3. Alerting Configuration:
   - Configure alerting thresholds with primary focus on error rates
   - Implement pager duty or similar on-call notification system when error rate exceeds 5%
   - Set up tiered alerting with different severity levels (warning at 2%, critical at 5%)
   - Create different alert channels (email, SMS, Slack) based on severity

4. Documentation:
   - Document the complete monitoring architecture
   - Create an escalation policy document detailing who gets notified and when
   - Provide troubleshooting guides for common alert scenarios
   - Include instructions for adding new metrics and alerts

The implementation should ensure minimal performance impact on production systems while providing comprehensive visibility into system health.

# Test Strategy:
Testing will verify both the monitoring capabilities and alerting functionality:

1. Metric Collection Testing:
   - Verify CloudWatch is correctly collecting all configured backend metrics by generating test traffic
   - Confirm Vercel Analytics is properly tracking frontend performance metrics
   - Validate that custom metrics are being recorded with expected granularity and accuracy

2. Alert Trigger Testing:
   - Simulate backend errors by creating an endpoint that returns 5xx errors on demand
   - Generate controlled error rates (2%, 5%, 10%) to verify different alert thresholds
   - Test frontend error tracking by injecting JavaScript errors at various rates

3. Notification Testing:
   - Verify that alerts are delivered through all configured channels (email, SMS, Slack)
   - Confirm that on-call notifications are properly routed according to the escalation policy
   - Test alert acknowledgment and resolution workflows

4. Dashboard Validation:
   - Verify all dashboards display accurate data
   - Confirm that dashboard refresh rates meet requirements
   - Test dashboard access controls

5. Recovery Testing:
   - Verify that alerts auto-resolve when error conditions return to normal
   - Test the system's behavior during recovery from high-error states

Document all test results with screenshots and logs as evidence of successful implementation.
