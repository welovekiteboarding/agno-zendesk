# Overview  
Project: AGNO‑powered “Bug‑Report LLM” with automatic Zendesk ticket creation  
Version: MVP‑1.0  
Author: (you)  
Date: 6 May 2025

## Purpose & Goals

Build a single‑button workflow inside our support portal that opens an LLM‑driven chat.
The LLM must:
1. Collect a complete, high‑quality bug report by forcing users to supply every critical field.
2. Verify / create the reporter in Zendesk.
3. Create a Zendesk ticket with correct requester + assignee metadata, attached files, and a well‑formatted markdown body.
4. Provide the user a ticket‑number confirmation and store an internal log for analytics.

Success = 95 %+ of submissions reach Zendesk without manual re‑write.

## Scope

Included: Chat‑based form collection, file upload, ticket creation, success UI, basic error handling  
Excluded: Auto‑triage / prioritisation, duplicate detection, AI ticket‑reply suggestions, analytics dashboards

## User Experience

### User Stories

| ID | As a…           | I want to…                                         | So that…                        |
|----|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| U1 | End‑user        | Click “Report a bug”, chat with the LLM, and get a ticket number | I know support has my issue     |
| U2 | QA/Support agent| Receive tickets with mandatory details & attachments| I can reproduce & fix faster    |
| U3 | Product owner   | Track submission metrics (success/fail counts)      | I can prove ROI of the LLM      |

# Technical Architecture

## Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Field Collection (Hard‑required unless noted)

| Field             | Validation rules                                                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reporter email    | RFC‑5322; verified via GET /users/search?query=email: – create user if none      |
| App version/build | Regex ^\d+\.\d+\.\d+\s\(\d+\)$                                                   |
| Platform / OS     | Select list; include version (e.g. iPadOS 17.4)                                 |
| Device model      | Free text (iPad Pro 11” M2)                                                     |
| Severity/impact   | Enum: Crash / Data loss / Functional bug / Minor UI                             |
| Steps to reproduce| ≥ 3 lines                                                                       |
| Expected result   | ≥ 1 line                                                                        |
| Actual result     | ≥ 1 line                                                                        |
| Time first observed| ISO‑8601 or “about 3 h ago” (parse to UTC)                                     |
| Attachments       | Optional – screenshots, screen recordings (≤ 100 MB), .skyset files, log files  |
| Consent checkbox  | GDPR consent to store diagnostic data                                           |

### 4.2 LLM Conversation Flow
1. Guardrails / JSON schema forces completion.
2. Missing or invalid fields trigger a follow‑up question loop.
3. Attachment uploads generate presigned S3/R2 URLs; LLM instructs user to drop files.
4. Final validated JSON handed to downstream agents.

### 4.3 AGNO Agent Pipeline

| Order | Agent              | Role                                                        |
|-------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| A1    | Form‑Collector     | Runs Guardrails loop; outputs JSON                          |
| A2    | Email‑Verifier     | Hits Zendesk users search; creates user if needed           |
| A3    | Attachment‑Uploader| Moves presigned files into permanent storage or Zendesk      |
| A4    | Ticket‑Poster      | Calls POST /tickets or /requests with requester_id, assignee_id/group_id, body & uploads |

### 4.4 Ticket Body Format (Markdown)
**Summary:** Crash when tapping “Observe”  
**App / Version:** SkySafari 7 Plus – 7.5.3 (1023)  
**OS / Device:** iPadOS 17.4 – iPad Pro 11" (M2)  

**Steps to Reproduce**  
1. …  
2. …  
3. …  

**Expected Result**  
Star chart opens.

**Actual Result**  
App quits to Home screen.

**Attachments**  
• screenshot.png  
• screenrec.mov  
• test.skyset

### 4.5 Assignment Logic
- assignee_id = rotating “Bug‑Intake” agent (configurable).
- Fallback: group_id = Mobile‑QA.
- Zendesk triggers can re‑route later.

## MVP requirements
- All functional requirements above
- All non-functional requirements below

## Future enhancements
- Auto‑triage / prioritisation
- Duplicate detection
- AI ticket‑reply suggestions
- Analytics dashboards

# Logical Dependency Chain

- Foundation: Form‑Collector agent and Guardrails schema
- Next: Email‑Verifier and Attachment‑Uploader agents
- Then: Ticket‑Poster agent and Zendesk integration
- Then: UX polish, logging, metrics, security, accessibility
- Finally: Analytics, dashboards, future enhancements

# Risks and Mitigations

- Technical challenges: Zendesk API integration, file upload reliability
- MVP scoping: Focus on required fields and happy path first
- Resource constraints: Prioritize agent pipeline and core flows

# Appendix

## Non‑Functional Requirements

| Area         | Requirement                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Performance  | Ticket created < 4 s (p95) after last user message                          |
| Reliability  | 99 % uptime, retries with exponential back‑off for Zendesk 5xx              |
| Security     | OAuth token stored in secret manager; presigned URLs valid 15 min; attachments virus‑scanned |
| Privacy      | GDPR consent captured; deletion API wired for “Right to be Forgotten”       |
| Scalability  | 20 concurrent sessions at launch; horizontal agent scaling                  |
| Accessibility| WCAG 2.1 AA for chat modal & uploads                                        |
| Localization | English only MVP; string table ready for i18n                               |

## UX / UI

1. “Report a Bug” button – visible in Help widget & app settings page.
2. Opens modal chat (re‑uses existing Vercel chat UI styles).
3. Progress indicator (“3 / 9 fields complete”).
4. Drag‑and‑drop area for files (mobile tap‑to‑select).
5. Confirmation screen with ticket link and “View my tickets” button.

## API Integration Details

- Zendesk – OAuth client (tickets:write, uploads:write, users:read write).
- Storage – S3 bucket bug‑uploads‑prod, lifecycle rule 90 days delete.
- Logging – CloudWatch (AGNO‑bug‑report‑logs) or Vercel Analytics event on success/failure.

## Open Questions

1. Auto‑assign severity based on LLM analysis vs. user selection?
2. Do we restrict file types (e.g., .skyset, .log, images/video) at upload time?
3. Slack/Teams notification of new tickets for QA team?
4. Rate‑limit anonymous reporters? (spam prevention)
5. Should attachments live in Zendesk or our own bucket long‑term?

## Success Metrics

- Submission success rate ≥ 95 % (ticket created).
- Avg. agent follow‑up emails ≤ 0.3 per ticket (proxy for report completeness).
- Median time to first response drops by 25 %.
- User CSAT on bug‑report flow ≥ 4.5 / 5.
