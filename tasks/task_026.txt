# Task ID: 26
# Title: Design Expandable Multi-Agent Architecture with Specialized Roles
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a sophisticated, extensible multi-agent architecture with specialized agent roles (Planner, Leader, Reflection, Research, Synthesis, Summarization) that initially focuses on multi-database RAG but can be expanded to include more specialized agents and tools. The system should employ a modular design where agents can be added, removed, or reconfigured with minimal code changes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Core Multi-Agent Framework with Orchestration Layer [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational architecture for a modular multi-agent system, including the central orchestration mechanism, agent registry, and communication protocols that will enable specialized agents to interact effectively.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design the Agent interface with standardized input/output contracts that all specialized agents must implement
2. Create an AgentRegistry class that handles dynamic registration, discovery, and instantiation of agents
3. Develop the Orchestrator class that coordinates agent interactions and workflow execution
4. Implement a MessageBus for standardized communication between agents with support for different message types
5. Design a WorkflowManager to handle the sequencing and routing of tasks between agents
6. Create a StateManager to maintain shared context across multi-agent workflows
7. Build a basic configuration system that allows for easy agent configuration
8. Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms

Testing approach:
- Unit test each component (Registry, Orchestrator, MessageBus) in isolation
- Create mock agents to test the communication protocols
- Test dynamic agent loading/unloading scenarios
- Verify state persistence across agent handoffs

## 2. Implement Specialized Agent Roles with Role-Specific Interfaces [done]
### Dependencies: 26.1
### Description: Develop the specialized agent implementations for core roles (Planner, Leader, Reflection, Research, Synthesis, Summarization) with well-defined interfaces that allow for future extension and customization.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Define role-specific interfaces extending the base Agent interface for each specialized role:
   - PlannerAgent: Task decomposition and strategy formulation
   - LeaderAgent: Coordination and decision-making
   - ReflectionAgent: Quality assessment and improvement suggestions
   - ResearchAgent: Information retrieval and analysis
   - SynthesisAgent: Combining information from multiple sources
   - SummarizationAgent: Condensing information for clarity
2. Implement abstract base classes for each role with common functionality
3. Create concrete implementations of each agent type with role-specific logic
4. Design tool integration interfaces for each agent type (e.g., RAG tools for ResearchAgent)
5. Implement agent-specific prompt templates and response parsers
6. Create specialized configuration schemas for each agent type
7. Add role-specific metrics collection for performance evaluation

Testing approach:
- Unit test each agent type with sample inputs and expected outputs
- Test agent configuration variations
- Verify proper implementation of role-specific interfaces
- Test agent response to various edge cases and failure modes

## 3. Build Workflow Designer and Integration Layer [done]
### Dependencies: 26.1, 26.2
### Description: Create a workflow design system that enables flexible agent composition patterns, tool integration, and seamless expansion of the architecture to include new agent types and capabilities.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design a WorkflowDefinition schema that supports various agent interaction patterns (sequential, parallel, conditional)
2. Implement a WorkflowDesigner interface for creating and modifying multi-agent workflows
3. Create a ToolIntegrationLayer that allows agents to access external tools and APIs
4. Develop adapters for integrating with existing Agno infrastructure
5. Implement a monitoring and telemetry system to track workflow execution
6. Create an evaluation framework to assess workflow performance
7. Build a plugin system for adding new agent types and tools
8. Develop comprehensive documentation including:
   - Architecture overview and design principles
   - Guidelines for creating new agent types
   - Workflow composition patterns and best practices
   - Extension and customization examples
9. Create sample workflows demonstrating RAG capabilities across multiple databases

Testing approach:
- Test complex workflows with multiple agent interactions
- Verify tool integration with mock external services
- Validate workflow execution metrics and monitoring
- Test the addition of new agent types at runtime
- Perform end-to-end testing of sample workflows
