# Task ID: 16
# Title: Documentation & Knowledge-Transfer: DevOps Runbook, API Contract, and Onboarding Guide
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive documentation including a DevOps runbook, API contract, and onboarding guide to facilitate knowledge transfer and smooth onboarding for new team members.
# Details:
Develop three key documentation components:

1. DevOps Runbook:
- Document the complete deployment process with step-by-step instructions
- Detail the agent pipeline configuration and workflow
- Include troubleshooting guides for common issues with resolution steps
- Document environment setup requirements and configuration
- Add monitoring and alerting procedures

2. API Contract:
- Document all API endpoints with request/response formats
- Include authentication requirements and error handling
- Provide example API calls and expected responses
- Document rate limits and performance considerations
- Include versioning strategy and deprecation policies

3. Onboarding Guide:
- Create step-by-step instructions for setting up the development environment
- Document project structure and architecture overview
- Include coding standards and best practices
- Provide access request procedures for various systems
- Add a glossary of project-specific terms and concepts

All documentation should be stored in the project repository in a dedicated 'docs' folder with proper formatting (Markdown preferred) and should be kept up-to-date with any system changes.

# Test Strategy:
The documentation will be validated through the following methods:

1. Peer Review:
- Have at least two team members review all documentation for accuracy and completeness
- Incorporate feedback and make necessary revisions

2. Practical Validation:
- Recruit a developer who is unfamiliar with the project
- Have them follow the onboarding guide to set up their environment
- Ask them to deploy the application using only the DevOps runbook
- Request them to make test API calls based solely on the API contract
- Document any points of confusion or missing information

3. Documentation Completeness Checklist:
- Verify all sections are complete with no placeholders or TODOs
- Ensure all links are working and references are accurate
- Confirm all diagrams and visual aids are clear and properly labeled
- Check that version information and dates are current

The documentation will be considered complete when a new team member can successfully set up, deploy, and interact with the system using only the provided documentation without requiring additional assistance.
