# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Agent Registry with Handoff Protocol
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement a centralized agent registry system with a standardized process for agent registration, discovery, and handoff trigger definition to ensure the multi-agent system is extensible and maintainable.
# Details:
The implementation should include:

1. **Registry Core Structure**:
   - Create a centralized `AgentRegistry` class that maintains a collection of registered agents
   - Implement methods for agent registration, deregistration, and lookup
   - Design a schema for agent metadata including capabilities, input/output formats, and operational constraints

2. **Agent Registration Process**:
   - Develop a standardized registration API that new agents must implement
   - Include validation of required agent interfaces and capabilities
   - Create a decorator or factory pattern for simplified agent registration

3. **Handoff Protocol**:
   - Define a clear schema for handoff triggers (conditions when one agent should transfer control to another)
   - Implement trigger evaluation logic that monitors agent state and determines when handoffs should occur
   - Create a handoff mechanism that properly transfers context and state between agents

4. **Configuration System**:
   - Design a YAML/JSON configuration format for defining agents and their relationships
   - Implement a configuration loader that can instantiate the agent ecosystem from configuration files
   - Support hot-reloading of configurations without system restart

5. **Documentation**:
   - Create comprehensive documentation for adding new agents
   - Document the handoff protocol and trigger definition process
   - Provide examples of common agent integration patterns

The implementation should follow the project's existing architectural patterns and coding standards. Ensure backward compatibility with existing agents in the system. The registry should be designed as a singleton service that can be accessed throughout the application.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should be comprehensive and include:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test the `AgentRegistry` class methods in isolation
   - Verify agent registration, deregistration, and lookup functionality
   - Test trigger evaluation logic with various conditions
   - Validate configuration loading and parsing

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Create mock agents that implement the registration interface
   - Test the full registration flow with multiple agents
   - Verify handoff scenarios between different agent types
   - Test configuration-driven agent ecosystem initialization

3. **System Tests**:
   - Deploy a test environment with multiple agents using the registry
   - Simulate complex workflows that require multiple agent handoffs
   - Verify that the system correctly manages agent state during handoffs
   - Test dynamic addition and removal of agents during runtime

4. **Performance Tests**:
   - Benchmark registry lookup performance with large numbers of agents
   - Test handoff latency under various system loads
   - Verify memory usage patterns during extended operation

5. **Documentation Verification**:
   - Have a developer unfamiliar with the system attempt to add a new agent using only the documentation
   - Verify that all public interfaces are properly documented
   - Ensure examples are accurate and functional

The test suite should include both positive tests (expected behavior) and negative tests (error handling, invalid inputs). All tests should be automated and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
