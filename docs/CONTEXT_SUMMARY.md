# Context Summary

## Task 1: Create Guardrails Schema for Form Collection

- Created foundational JSON schema structure with required bug report fields and types. [pending]
- Added regex pattern validations for email and app version fields. [pending]
- Implemented minimum line count validations for descriptive fields. [pending]
- Defined enumeration constraints for severity/impact field. [pending]
- Added support for optional attachments and GDPR consent. [pending]
- Verified schema with Ajv JSON schema validator tests covering valid and invalid payloads. [pending]

This comprehensive work is planned to ensure robust validation and data integrity for bug report submissions in the system.

The code changes to be completed can be summarized as follows:

1. **Add `__init__.py` file**: This file will mark the `agents_from_scratch` directory as a Python package. [pending]

2. **Add compiled Python files**: Compiled Python files (`.pyc` files) will be generated in the `__pycache__` directory after code execution. [pending]

3. **Add new Python files**: The following new Python files are to be created:
   - `form_collector_agent.py`: Defines the `FormCollectorAgent` class, which is the main agent class responsible for collecting and processing user input. [pending]
   - ...
The code changes can be summarized as follows:

- **Added `__init__.py` file**: This file marks the `agents_from_scratch` directory as a Python package.
- **Added compiled Python files**: Several compiled Python files (`.pyc` files) have been added to the `__pycache__` directory, indicating that the code has been compiled and cached for faster execution.
- **Added new Python files**: The following new Python files have been added:
  - `form_collector_agent.py`: Defines the `FormCollectorAgent` class, which is the main agent class responsible for collecting and processing user input.
  - `form_collector_agent_flow
Sure, I'd be happy to summarize the code changes in 1-3 concise bullet points. Please provide the code changes, and I'll summarize them for you.
Based on the provided code changes, the summary can be presented in the following concise bullet points:

- Added a new `main.py` file in the `backend` directory, which is the entry point for the FastAPI application.
- Configured the FastAPI application with the following settings:
  - Set the title of the application to "Bug-Report LLM Backend".
  - Added CORS middleware to allow requests from the production and local development origins.
- Imported and registered the `form_collector_chat` router with the prefix `/api/form-collector` and the tag "Form-Collector".
