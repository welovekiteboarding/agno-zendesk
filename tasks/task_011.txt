# Task ID: 11
# Title: Deployment Descriptors & CI/CD Bootstrap
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create deployment configuration files and CI/CD workflows to enable automatic deployment of preview environments for both frontend and backend components of the application.
# Details:
This task involves setting up several configuration files to enable automated deployments:

1. **Frontend Configuration**:
   - Create `frontend/vercel.json` with edge rewrites configuration to handle frontend routing properly
   - Configure path rewrites to ensure SPA routing works correctly
   - Set up environment variable handling

2. **Backend Configuration**:
   - Create `backend/Dockerfile` that properly packages the FastAPI+AGNO application
   - Include all necessary dependencies and set up proper entry points
   - Configure environment variables and health check endpoints
   - Optimize the Docker image for production use (multi-stage builds if appropriate)

3. **Cloud Hosting Configuration**:
   - Create either `render.yaml` or `fly.toml` in the project root to define backend service deployment
   - Configure auto-deployment settings, environment variables, and resource allocations
   - Set up database connections and other service dependencies

4. **CI/CD Workflow**:
   - Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to automate the deployment process
   - Configure the workflow to run tests before deployment
   - Set up branch-based preview deployments
   - Ensure proper secrets and environment variables are used
   - Configure notifications for deployment success/failure

Ensure all configuration files follow best practices for security and performance.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Local Testing**:
   - Validate Dockerfile locally by building and running the container
   - Test vercel.json configuration with Vercel CLI if possible

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Push changes to a feature branch to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow
   - Verify that the workflow runs successfully and completes all steps
   - Confirm that preview environments are automatically created on both Vercel (frontend) and Render/Fly.io (backend)

3. **Validation**:
   - Access the generated preview URLs for both frontend and backend
   - Verify that the frontend application loads correctly and routing works
   - Check that the backend API endpoints are accessible and return expected responses
   - Run health checks against the deployed services
   - Test the integration between frontend and backend in the preview environment

4. **Documentation**:
   - Document the URLs and patterns for preview environments
   - Verify that the deployment process is properly documented for the team
