# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement AstraDB RAG Integration for Zendesk Support
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 21
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation solution using AstraDB to provide a knowledge base for the Agno agent in the Zendesk support interface.
# Details:
This task involves creating a complete RAG pipeline integrated with AstraDB and the existing Agno agent system in Zendesk. Key components include:

1. **AstraDB Connection Setup**:
   - Configure secure connection to AstraDB using appropriate authentication credentials
   - Implement connection pooling for efficient database access
   - Create error handling for connection failures with appropriate fallbacks

2. **Vector Search Implementation**:
   - Implement text embedding functionality using an appropriate embedding model (e.g., OpenAI embeddings)
   - Create vector search queries with configurable similarity thresholds
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed vector searches to improve performance

3. **Agno Agent Integration**:
   - Extend the existing Agno agent to query the RAG system before generating responses
   - Implement a context window management system to include retrieved information
   - Create a confidence scoring mechanism to determine when to use retrieved information

4. **Document Loading Pipeline**:
   - Build a document processing pipeline that can ingest various formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML, etc.)
   - Implement chunking strategies for optimal retrieval performance
   - Create metadata extraction for improved search relevance
   - Develop an indexing system for newly added documents

5. **Interface with Unified Chat**:
   - Ensure the RAG system integrates with the unified chat interface from Task 21
   - Add UI elements to display source documents when information is retrieved
   - Implement feedback mechanisms to improve retrieval quality over time

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this RAG integration should be thorough and cover multiple aspects of the system:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test AstraDB connection handling with mocked responses
   - Verify embedding generation functions correctly process text inputs
   - Test document chunking logic with various document types and sizes
   - Validate vector search functions return expected results for known queries

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test end-to-end document processing pipeline with sample documents
   - Verify correct storage and retrieval of embedded documents in AstraDB
   - Test integration with the Agno agent using simulated queries
   - Validate the system handles connection failures gracefully

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Measure response time for various query complexities
   - Test system under load with concurrent requests
   - Verify caching mechanisms improve performance for repeated queries

4. **Functional Tests**:
   - Create a test set of common support questions and verify retrieval accuracy
   - Test with edge cases like very short queries or ambiguous questions
   - Verify source attribution is correct for retrieved information
   - Test with multilingual content if applicable

5. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Have support staff test the system with real-world scenarios
   - Collect metrics on retrieval relevance and accuracy
   - Validate that the UI elements for displaying sources are intuitive and helpful

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement AstraDB Connection and Document Loading Pipeline [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the AstraDB connection infrastructure and create a document processing pipeline that can ingest, chunk, and store documents in the vector database.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Configure AstraDB client with authentication credentials using environment variables for security
2. Implement connection pooling mechanism with configurable pool size and timeout settings
3. Create robust error handling for connection failures with exponential backoff retry logic
4. Develop document loaders for multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML) using appropriate libraries
5. Implement text chunking strategies with configurable chunk size and overlap parameters
6. Create metadata extraction functions to capture document source, date, and section information
7. Build an indexing system that tracks document versions and update timestamps
8. Implement a batch processing mechanism for efficient document ingestion

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for connection handling with mocked AstraDB responses
- Integration tests with a test AstraDB instance
- Test document loading with various file formats and sizes
- Verify chunking strategies with different document types
- Measure indexing performance with large document sets

## 2. Develop Vector Search and Embedding Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Implement text embedding generation and vector search capabilities, including caching mechanisms for performance optimization.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Integrate an embedding model (OpenAI embeddings) with appropriate dimension settings
2. Create a vector embedding generation service with batching capabilities for efficiency
3. Implement vector search queries with configurable similarity thresholds and result limits
4. Develop a caching layer for frequently accessed embeddings using Redis or an in-memory solution
5. Create cache invalidation strategies based on time and usage patterns
6. Implement logging for search performance metrics and hit/miss ratios
7. Build relevance scoring functions to rank search results
8. Create fallback strategies for when vector search returns low confidence results

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for embedding generation with sample texts
- Performance tests for caching mechanisms with simulated high-load scenarios
- Integration tests for vector search with pre-populated test data
- Accuracy tests comparing search results against expected outcomes
- Benchmark tests for response times under various load conditions

## 3. Integrate RAG System with Agno Agent and Zendesk Interface [done]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2
### Description: Connect the RAG system to the existing Agno agent and Zendesk unified chat interface, including UI elements for displaying retrieved information.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Extend the Agno agent to query the RAG system before generating responses
2. Implement a context window management system to include retrieved information within token limits
3. Create a confidence scoring mechanism to determine when to use retrieved vs. generated information
4. Integrate with the unified chat interface from Task 21
5. Add UI components to display source documents and reference links when information is retrieved
6. Implement user feedback collection (thumbs up/down) on retrieval quality
7. Create an analytics dashboard for monitoring RAG system performance
8. Develop A/B testing capability to compare different retrieval strategies

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for agent-RAG integration logic
- Integration tests with the full Zendesk environment
- UI tests for source document display functionality
- User acceptance testing with support team members
- End-to-end tests simulating complete customer support scenarios
- Performance testing under production-like conditions
