# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Monitoring & Alerting System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting infrastructure using CloudWatch and Vercel metrics to track application health and performance across both backend and frontend systems.
# Details:
This task involves implementing a robust monitoring and alerting system with the following components:

1. CloudWatch Integration:
   - Set up CloudWatch metrics for backend services
   - Configure custom metrics for API response times, error rates, and resource utilization
   - Create CloudWatch dashboards for visualizing key performance indicators

2. Vercel Metrics Integration:
   - Implement Vercel Analytics for frontend performance monitoring
   - Track core web vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) and custom frontend metrics
   - Set up real-time monitoring for frontend errors and performance degradation

3. Alerting Configuration:
   - Configure alerting thresholds with primary focus on error rates (â‰¥5% error rate should trigger pager duty)
   - Implement tiered alerting with different severity levels based on threshold values
   - Set up notification channels (email, SMS, Slack) for different alert types

4. Documentation:
   - Create comprehensive documentation of the monitoring architecture
   - Document all configured metrics, their sources, and significance
   - Establish a clear escalation policy with contact information and response procedures
   - Include troubleshooting guides for common alert scenarios

The implementation should ensure minimal performance impact while providing actionable insights. All alerts should include contextual information to facilitate quick diagnosis and resolution.

# Test Strategy:
Testing will verify both the monitoring capabilities and the alerting functionality:

1. Monitoring Verification:
   - Inject synthetic transactions to verify metrics are being properly recorded
   - Validate that custom metrics appear correctly in CloudWatch and Vercel dashboards
   - Verify data retention policies and sampling rates are correctly configured
   - Confirm that metrics have appropriate tags/dimensions for filtering

2. Alert Testing:
   - Simulate backend errors by temporarily modifying API responses to return 5xx status codes
   - Create frontend errors using controlled JavaScript exceptions
   - Gradually increase error rates to verify threshold-based alerting (test at 3%, 5%, and 10%)
   - Verify that alerts contain sufficient diagnostic information

3. End-to-End Tests:
   - Perform a controlled production test during off-hours
   - Verify alert delivery across all configured notification channels
   - Measure time from error injection to alert receipt
   - Test the escalation policy by acknowledging/ignoring initial alerts

4. Documentation Validation:
   - Conduct a review session with team members not involved in implementation
   - Have a team member follow the documentation to diagnose a simulated issue
   - Verify all team members can access and understand the monitoring dashboards
