# Task ID: 21
# Title: Unify Chat Interface Components
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 19, 20
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a consolidated chat interface that integrates the Agent Registry and UI Instruction Protocol to provide a seamless experience with all required functionality.
# Details:
This task involves creating a unified chat interface that brings together all the different components and functionality that are currently spread across multiple implementations. The goal is to have a single, cohesive chat experience that incorporates:

1. **Unified Component Architecture**:
   - Create a new `UnifiedChatUI` component that combines the best features of existing implementations
   - Ensure proper integration with the Agent Registry for agent management and handoffs
   - Configure the component to work correctly with the UI Instruction Protocol
   - Support all required UI components including file uploads, forms, and dynamic elements

2. **Routing and Navigation**:
   - Update the application routing to use the unified component as the primary interface
   - Implement redirects from legacy test URLs to the main chat interface
   - Ensure deep linking and URL parameter support for testing specific features

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test the complete conversation flow from initial greeting to form submission
   - Verify agent handoffs function correctly within the unified interface
   - Ensure file uploads, scanning, and submission work properly
   - Test with various input scenarios to validate robustness

4. **Documentation and Cleanup**:
   - Document the unified architecture and component interaction
   - Remove or deprecate redundant components and code
   - Update any references or documentation to reflect the new unified approach

The implementation should provide a seamless user experience while maintaining all the functionality that was previously spread across different components. It should leverage the Agent Registry for conversation management and the UI Instruction Protocol for dynamic interface updates.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should be comprehensive to ensure the unified interface works correctly in all scenarios:

1. **Component Integration Testing**:
   - Verify the UnifiedChatUI correctly integrates with the Agent Registry
   - Test UI Instruction handling for all supported component types
   - Ensure state management correctly handles instruction sequences and priorities

2. **Conversation Flow Testing**:
   - Test complete conversation flows from initial greeting to submission
   - Verify agent handoffs work correctly (Agno â†’ Form Collector)
   - Test error recovery and resumption of interrupted conversations

3. **File Upload Testing**:
   - Verify file upload UI appears at the appropriate time in the conversation
   - Test file uploads with various file types and sizes
   - Confirm scanning status updates correctly
   - Verify submission with attachments works properly

4. **Routing and Navigation Testing**:
   - Test all routes to ensure they lead to the unified interface
   - Verify redirects from legacy test URLs work correctly
   - Test deep linking with URL parameters for specific features

5. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure component render performance
   - Test with long conversations to ensure responsiveness
   - Verify memory usage remains stable during extended use

6. **Cross-browser Testing**:
   - Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
   - Verify on mobile devices and responsive layouts

Document all testing with screenshots and validation steps to demonstrate the functionality works as expected across all scenarios.
