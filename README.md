# AGNO Bug-Report LLM System

This project implements an LLM-powered bug report workflow integrated with Zendesk, using the Agno agent framework. Users interact with a chat-based form that collects all required bug report fields, validates them, and uploads attachments. The system verifies/creates the reporter in Zendesk, creates a ticket with all metadata and files, and provides confirmation to the user.

## Features

- LLM-driven chat form for bug report collection
- Strict field validation and follow-up for missing/invalid data
- Zendesk user verification and ticket creation
- File upload via presigned S3/R2 URLs
- Modular agent pipeline (Form-Collector, Email-Verifier, Attachment-Uploader, Ticket-Poster)
- Success/failure logging and analytics

## Context Management

This project uses a context-management workflow to ensure all key decisions and project context are captured and accessible:

- **docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md**: Contains the project vision, impact, and scope. Read this for a high-level understanding of the project's goals and benefits.
- **docs/CONTEXT_SUMMARY.md**: A rolling summary file. Each merged PR appends 5â€“10 bullet decisions here, providing a concise history of important changes and decisions.

A GitHub Action (.github/workflows/update-context.yml) automatically updates the context summary after each merged PR by summarizing the diff using GPT-4o.

**Cost-control tactic:**  
Developers should reference these docs in their prompts and reviews instead of pasting long chat or code history, reducing token usage and improving efficiency.
