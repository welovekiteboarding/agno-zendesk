# Context Summary

## Task 1: Create Guardrails Schema for Form Collection

This task involved developing a comprehensive JSON schema to enforce the collection of all required bug report fields with proper validation rules. The work included the following subtasks:

### 1. Define Basic Schema Structure and Required Fields
- Created the foundational JSON schema structure with all required bug report fields and their basic types.
- Defined required fields such as reporter name, email, app version, device/OS, steps to reproduce, expected result, actual result, severity/impact, and GDPR consent.
- Set appropriate data types (string, boolean, array) and marked required fields.

### 2. Implement Regex Pattern Validations
- Added regex pattern validations for fields requiring specific formats.
- Implemented RFC-5322 compliant regex for email validation.
- Created regex pattern for app version format (e.g., "1.2.3 (1234)").
- Documented each regex pattern with comments explaining the validation logic.

### 3. Add Length and Content Validations
- Implemented minimum line requirements for descriptive fields.
- Added pattern validations to enforce minimum lines for steps to reproduce (≥3 lines), expected result (≥1 line), and actual result (≥1 line).

### 4. Implement Enumeration Constraints for Categorical Fields
- Defined enumeration constraints for the severity/impact field.
- Added enum options: "Critical", "High", "Medium", "Low".

### 5. Add Support for Optional Fields and Final Integration
- Added support for optional attachments (screenshots, logs, etc.).
- Ensured GDPR consent checkbox is properly implemented as a required boolean field.
- Integrated all schema components into a cohesive whole.
- Finalized the schema with appropriate metadata, descriptions, and documentation.

### Testing
- Verified the schema with existing tests using Ajv JSON schema validator.
- Tests cover validation of valid payloads and failure cases for missing required fields.

This comprehensive work ensures robust validation and data integrity for bug report submissions in the system.
