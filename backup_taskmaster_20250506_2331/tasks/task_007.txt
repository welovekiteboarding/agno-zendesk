# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Chat UI with File Upload
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the user-facing chat interface that allows users to interact with the LLM and upload files.
# Details:
Develop a modal chat interface that reuses existing Vercel chat UI styles as specified in the UX/UI section. Implement a progress indicator showing '3/9 fields complete' to track form completion. Create a drag-and-drop area for file uploads with mobile tap-to-select functionality. Integrate with the Form-Collector agent for conversation flow and the Attachment Upload microservice for file handling. Ensure the UI meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards and prepare string tables for future localization.

# Test Strategy:
Test the UI on various devices and browsers. Verify accessibility compliance with automated tools and manual testing. Test file upload functionality with various file types and sizes. Confirm progress indicator accurately reflects form completion status.
